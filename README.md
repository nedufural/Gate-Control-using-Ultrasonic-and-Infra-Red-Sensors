# Gate-Control-using-Ultrasonic-and-Infra-Red-Sensors
This project is to implement a door control for parking garage using two proximity sensors 
the  Infra Red and Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the distance from when the car passes through one door to when it is actually in the car-park.
The Processing is done using an Arduino Uno board.
and the Arduino IDE
